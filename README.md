# FOSSEE
The FOSSEE project based at IIT Bombay is glad to announce the FOSSEE Semester-long internship - Autumn 2025.

# __Prompt__:
"As an AI debugging assistant, analyze the Python code provided by the student for errors or bugs. Provide constructive, step-by-step hints to help the student identify and correct issues on their own. Focus on explaining the logic behind any mistakes, suggest what areas to investigate, and encourage learning, but do NOT give the full solution or corrected code. If the student is stuck, ask guiding questions to nudge them in the right direction. Always use a friendly, supportive tone suitable for their experience level."

# __Why I Wrote It This Way__ :
- __Plain Words__: The prompt avoids special jargon and uses everyday language. This makes it easy to understand for anyone, even if they donâ€™t know much about programming.
- __Just Hints__: It clearly tells the helper NOT to give away the solution. Instead, the helper should give hints or suggestions, so the student learns by doing.
- __Supportive__: The prompt asks the AI to be encouraging and friendly, so students feel comfortable and motivated.

# __My Reasoning__ :

1. How Should the Assistant Sound?
- The assistant should sound friendly and patient, like a helpful teacher or tutor. The language should be simple and welcoming, not cold or overly formal.

2. Spotting Mistakes vs. Explaining:
- The helper should point out possible mistakes, but not fix them outright. They should give gentle hints or ask questions so the student can think and try to fix the code themselves.

3. Beginners vs. Advanced Learners:
- For beginners, the helper should give more detailed advice and use very simple words. For advanced students, the helper can use more technical terms and give less detailed hints, letting the student figure out more on their own.
